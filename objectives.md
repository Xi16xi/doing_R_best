## Study Objectives

# Research Questions:
- How does elevation affect the abundance of differnet orders of insects?
- How does latitude affect the abundance of differnet orders of insects?
- Within orders, do all genus/species show the same pattern or do they differ?
- Between orders, do they show the same pattern, or different?

# Possible outcomes:
- Order abundance increases with elevation/latitude 
- Order abundance decreases with elevation/latitude 
- Order abundance does not change with elevation/latitude 
- Some order may be more/less sensitive to changes in elevation/latitude than others
- Within orders, genus/species show the same patterns as the parameters (ele/lat) change
- Within orders, genus/species show different patterns as the parameters change
- Between orders, orders show the same patterns as parameters change
- Between orders, orders show differnet patterns as parameters change
