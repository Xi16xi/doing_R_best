1. *Respect everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion*. NO EXCEPTIONS. Harassment in any form will not be tolerated.  
2. *Conflicts are resolved by "majority rules"*. If there is an issue, the group votes on it and if a majority of the group agrees on one solution, we go with that. If there is a tie we sit down and discuss our options and revote until one solution is chosen that satisfies a majority of the group.
3. *Get work done by deadlines*. When deadlines are set by the group they must be met by all member to ensure the project can keep moving forward. 
4. *Show up on time for scheduled meetings*. Everyone's time is valuable so respect each other by showing up on time or letting the group know if you will be late. 
5. *Come to class (unless you really can’t)*. We want to utilize our class time to complete as much of this project as possible, so it is essential that we all show up unless decided otherwise.
6. *Tell your group mates if you run into a problem you can’t solve on your own*. There is no shame in asking for help. Your teammates might know something you don't.  
7. *Respect each other's ideas*. Everyone's opinion is valid and everyone's opinions and ideas must be considered before decisions are made.
