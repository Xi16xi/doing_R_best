## Possible Analysis

- Sort dataset by order
- Graph sorted data to get a sense of what is going on between/within orders 
- Test data for assumptions prior to running model
- Create linear model to see how much abundance changes with lat and ele and whether these are important factors in determining insect abundance
- Find best fit model using AIC

## Possible Results Table 
- Table of output of linear models
- Potentially just those that are significant if there are too many outputs to record in the final report (condensed figure for show)

## Possible Results Figure
- Figures to show abundance v latitude/elevation (scatter)
- Coloured by order (or species/family/genus if we break it down more)
- Fitting linear model onto graph to see how well model fits the data 
- Potentially use confidence intervals
