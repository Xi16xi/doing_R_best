Below contains details about the mock figures in pseudo-figure caption format:

Mock Figure 1:
•	This graph will look at how elevation affects abundance. 
•	We will first make a graph that looks at how the order’s abundance is affected by elevation. 
•	We will then make a graph for each order and see if within orders how elevation affects abundance. 
•	A) abundance increases with elevation 
•	B) abundance doesn’t change with elevation 
•	C) abundance decreases with elevation 

Mock Figure 2:
•	This graph will look at how abundance changes with time 
•	We will first make a graph that looks at how the order’s abundance changes with time 
•	We will then make a graph for each order and see if within orders how abundance changes with time 
•	A) abundance increases with time 
•	B) abundance doesn’t change with time 
•	C) abundance decreases with time

Mock Figure 3:
•	This graph will look at how latitude affects abundance. 
•	We will first make a graph that looks at how the order’s abundance is affected by latitude. 
•	We will then make a graph for each order and see if within orders how latitude affects abundance. 
•	A) abundance increases with latitude 
•	B) abundance doesn’t change with latitude 
•	C) abundance decreases with latitude
