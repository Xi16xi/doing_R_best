## Introduction to Project
Our project is concerning the abundance of insects in Costa Rica related to different geographical variables such as latitude and elevation. The goal of this project is to assess how abundance of insects is affected by latitude and elevation between and within orders of insects across tiime. This is important in investigating which orders of insects are more at risk of extinction and determine which orders are more important for conservation efforts. 

## Description of the Data
The dataset contains 3.25 million rows of data on insects species in Costa Rica including their latitude, longitude, elevation, and date of data collection. The occurrence records of the Insecta class from 1963 to 2015 were collected, identified, digitized, and published by the National Biodiversity Institute (INBio) of Costa Rica.
